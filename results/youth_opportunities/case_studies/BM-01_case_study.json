    "title": "YouthShell Mobile Threshing Service: From Graduate to Agripreneur",
    "entrepreneur": "Ibrahim Mohammed, 27, Kaduna State",
    "background": "\n            After graduating with a diploma in Agricultural Engineering, Ibrahim struggled to find formal \n            employment. Noticing farmers in his community spending days manually threshing maize and \n            losing significant portions to breakage and contamination, he saw a business opportunity.\n            ",
    "starting_point": "\n            Ibrahim started in 2023 with a single maize sheller purchased through a NIRSAL youth loan of \n            N500,000 with 20% personal contribution from his savings. He transported the machine using a \n            rented motorcycle initially.\n            ",
    "implementation": "\n            He began by offering free demonstrations to skeptical farmers, showing how his machine could \n            shell in minutes what took hours manually. Word spread quickly after harvest season began. \n            Ibrahim created a simple schedule, traveling between five villages on specific days of the week.\n            ",
    "challenges_faced": "\n            Early challenges included machine breakdowns due to maintenance inexperience, seasonal gaps in \n            revenue, and initial farmer hesitation. Ibrahim addressed these by obtaining technical training, \n            expanding to sorghum and rice threshing to cover different seasons, and documenting results to \n            show unconvinced farmers.\n            ",
    "results": "\n            By the end of the first year, Ibrahim had served over 200 farmers and processed approximately \n            300 tons of grain. His service reduced farmers' threshing costs by 40% while saving them \n            substantial time. Post-harvest losses decreased by an estimated 15% due to faster processing \n            and reduced grain damage.\n            \n            Ibrahim generated a gross revenue of N750,000 in the first year with net profits of N280,000 \n            after expenses. By the second year, he purchased a dedicated tricycle for transportation and \n            added a second threshing machine to expand operations.\n            ",

    "future_plans": "\n            Ibrahim now employs two assistants and plans to expand to neighboring local government areas. \n            He's exploring adding cleaning and weighing services to increase his value proposition and \n            working with a microfinance institution to offer farmers short-term storage options.\n            "
