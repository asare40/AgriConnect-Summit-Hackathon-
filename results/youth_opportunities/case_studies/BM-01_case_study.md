# Case Study: YouthShell Mobile Threshing Service: From Graduate to Agripreneur

**Entrepreneur:** Ibrahim Mohammed, 27, Kaduna State

## Background

After graduating with a diploma in Agricultural Engineering, Ibrahim struggled to find formal 
            employment. Noticing farmers in his community spending days manually threshing maize and 
            losing significant portions to breakage and contamination, he saw a business opportunity.

## Starting Point

Ibrahim started in 2023 with a single maize sheller purchased through a NIRSAL youth loan of 
            N500,000 with 20% personal contribution from his savings. He transported the machine using a 
            rented motorcycle initially.

## Implementation

He began by offering free demonstrations to skeptical farmers, showing how his machine could 
            shell in minutes what took hours manually. Word spread quickly after harvest season began. 
            Ibrahim created a simple schedule, traveling between five villages on specific days of the week.

## Challenges Faced

Early challenges included machine breakdowns due to maintenance inexperience, seasonal gaps in 
            revenue, and initial farmer hesitation. Ibrahim addressed these by obtaining technical training, 
            expanding to sorghum and rice threshing to cover different seasons, and documenting results to 
            show unconvinced farmers.

## Results

By the end of the first year, Ibrahim had served over 200 farmers and processed approximately 
            300 tons of grain. His service reduced farmers' threshing costs by 40% while saving them 
            substantial time. Post-harvest losses decreased by an estimated 15% due to faster processing 
            and reduced grain damage.
            
            Ibrahim generated a gross revenue of N750,000 in the first year with net profits of N280,000 
            after expenses. By the second year, he purchased a dedicated tricycle for transportation and 
            added a second threshing machine to expand operations.

## Key Lessons

- Free demonstrations were crucial for overcoming initial farmer skepticism
- Technical knowledge of equipment repair saved significant downtime and costs
- Mapping multiple crop seasons extended the business operating period
- Building relationships with village leaders created trust and facilitated entry to new communities
- Simple recordkeeping on a mobile app helped optimize routes and scheduling

## Future Plans

Ibrahim now employs two assistants and plans to expand to neighboring local government areas. 
            He's exploring adding cleaning and weighing services to increase his value proposition and 
            working with a microfinance institution to offer farmers short-term storage options.
