He transported the machine using a \n            rented motorcycle initially.\n            ",

His service reduced farmers' threshing costs by 40% while saving them \n            substantial time. Post-harvest losses decreased by an estimated 15% due to faster processing \n            and reduced grain damage.\n            \n            Ibrahim generated a gross revenue of N750,000 in the first year with net profits of N280,000 \n            after expenses. By the second year, he purchased a dedicated tricycle for transportation and \n            added a second threshing machine to expand operations.\n            ",
