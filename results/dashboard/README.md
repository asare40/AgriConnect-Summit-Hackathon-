# YouthHarvest Dashboard

## Overview
The YouthHarvest Dashboard is an interactive tool that helps young Nigerian entrepreneurs identify and pursue business opportunities in the post-harvest sector. By visualizing post-harvest loss data and connecting it to viable business models, the dashboard enables youth to make informed decisions about which interventions to implement in their local context.

## Features
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Explore post-harvest loss patterns across different states, crops, and value chain stages
- **Business Opportunity Finder**: Discover the most promising business models for your region and interests
- **Implementation Guide Access**: Connect directly to detailed guides for setting up post-harvest businesses
- **Filtering Capabilities**: Customize the view based on your location, crop interests, and investment capacity
