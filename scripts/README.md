# Nigeria Post-Harvest Losses Analysis Project

## Project: YouthHarvest

YouthHarvest is a comprehensive data-driven solution designed to address Nigeria's significant post-harvest loss challenge while creating sustainable entrepreneurship opportunities for youth. By analyzing post-harvest loss patterns across crops, regions, and value chain stages, YouthHarvest identifies high-impact intervention points and provides structured business models and implementation strategies that can be deployed by young agripreneurs.
