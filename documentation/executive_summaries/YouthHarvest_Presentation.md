- All models are designed to generate positive cash flow within the first year of operation

**Q: How will youth access the capital needed to start these businesses?**

A: Our implementation strategy includes:
1. Partnerships with financial institutions offering youth-in-agriculture loans (5-9% interest vs. typical 25%)
2. Equipment leasing arrangements with pay-as-you-earn models
3. Cooperative financing options to share investment costs
4. Links to existing grant programs and competitions
5. A staged investment approach allowing youth to begin with minimal capital and reinvest earnings

## Technical Feasibility Questions

**Q: Do Nigerian youth have the technical skills needed for these businesses?**

A: Each business model in our portfolio:

- Is supported by our proposed training partners for skill development
- Many models build on existing agricultural knowledge that rural youth already possess

**Q: How will the technology work in areas with limited infrastructure?**

A: We've designed our solutions specifically for the Nigerian context:
- Solar drying technology works without grid electricity
- Mobile services bring processing capability directly to farms
- Digital components have offline functionality for areas with intermittent connectivity
- Equipment selections focus on durability, repairability with local parts, and appropriateness for rural conditions
