# YouthHarvest: Reducing Post-Harvest Losses to Create Youth-Led Agribusinesses in Nigeria
*2025-05-12*

## Project Overview
YouthHarvest is a comprehensive data-driven solution designed to address Nigeria's significant post-harvest loss challenge while creating sustainable entrepreneurship opportunities for youth. By analyzing post-harvest loss patterns across crops, regions, and value chain stages, YouthHarvest identifies high-impact intervention points and provides structured business models and implementation strategies that can be deployed by young agripreneurs.

## Problem Analysis

### Post-Harvest Loss Magnitude
Our analysis of post-harvest losses across Nigeria's major crops revealed significant regional variations in both the scale and nature of losses. The North West region experiences the highest absolute losses (1.25-1.45 million tons annually), while the North East and South South regions have the highest percentage losses (30-45% of production).

### Economic Impact
The financial impact of post-harvest losses amounts to N15-20 billion annually across the analyzed crops. Our opportunity analysis indicates that 40-60% of these losses could be addressed through appropriate interventions, representing N6-12 billion in retrievable value.

### Youth Dimension
Nigeria's youth unemployment stands at approximately 42.5% for ages 15-34, representing a significant social and economic challenge. The post-harvest sector offers particular advantages for youth engagement due to its technology orientation, service-based nature, moderate capital requirements, and year-round income potential.

## Solution Components

### Data Analytics Framework
YouthHarvest's data framework integrates production data, post-harvest loss rates, value chain analysis, and economic modeling to identify intervention opportunities. The framework includes spatial analysis to pinpoint high-priority regions and crop-specific loss patterns.

### Youth Business Models
We developed seven detailed business models specifically designed for youth implementation in the post-harvest sector. Each model includes comprehensive operational guidelines, financial projections, risk assessments, and implementation steps.

### Interactive Dashboard
The YouthHarvest Dashboard provides an interactive tool for exploring post-harvest loss patterns and identifying business opportunities. The dashboard visualizes loss data across regions, crops, and value chain stages.

### Regional Implementation Roadmaps
Recognizing Nigeria's regional diversity, we developed tailored implementation roadmaps for each geopolitical zone. These roadmaps account for regional agricultural patterns, infrastructure, security considerations, and market structures.

## Impact Projections

### Post-Harvest Loss Reduction
Based on our intervention models and implementation strategies, we project that YouthHarvest could achieve 15-20% reduction in post-harvest losses in targeted value chains within three years, representing approximately 1.5-2 million tons of food saved annually.

### Youth Entrepreneurship
The YouthHarvest approach can directly support the creation of 5,000-7,000 youth-led agribusinesses across all business models and 15,000-25,000 direct jobs within these businesses.

### Market Improvement
Beyond direct loss reduction and job creation, YouthHarvest interventions are projected to contribute to improved product quality, more stable supply patterns, and increased farmer income through better price realization.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phased Approach
YouthHarvest is designed for phased implementation over a three-year period across Nigeria's geopolitical zones, starting with priority regions and expanding based on demonstrated success.

### Partnership Framework
Successful implementation requires a multi-stakeholder approach including government agencies, financial institutions, private sector actors, educational institutions, and youth organizations.

### Sustainability Measures
The YouthHarvest approach emphasizes sustainability through focus on business viability rather than subsidy-dependent models and building local institutional capacity for ongoing support.
